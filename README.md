# Cue
Cue is a Markdown-style language for writing stories for print, screen, and stage.

The library presented here for parsing Cue is still in early stages of development. 

## Dependencies
A top priority of the Cue library has been the ability to run without any external dependencies. As a result, anything that can compile Swift can compile the Cue library.

## Installation
I recommend using the Swift Package Mangager to install Cue. 

## Usage
The bread and butter of the Cue library is the Cue class, which accepts a string and provides a handful of views onto the parsed data.

```swift
import Cue

let parser = Cue("Hello world!")

let ast = parser.ast 
// An abstract syntax tree

let table = parser.tableOfContents
// An array representing a table of contents

let html = parser.html()
// Transforms the parsed input into HTML.

let names = parser.namedEntitiesDictionary
// A dictionary of names, counting their occurences in the original string
```

### Abstract Syntax Tree
The returned AST comes with a number of powerful methods for traversing and querying.

```swift
ast.enumerate { (node) in
	// Performs a depth-first traversal. Does not support transformation.
}

ast.walk { (event, node, shouldBreak) in
	// Performs a depth-first traversal. Supports tree transformation.
}

var current = ast.children.first
while let next = current {
	// Traverses child nodes in sequence
	current = next.next
}

let opts = SearchOptions(deepSearch: true, searchPredicate: { (node) in
	return node is Description
})
if let found = ast.search(for: searchIndex, options: opts) {
	// Finds and returns a node that matches the search query. If none, search returns nil.
}

let nodes = ast.childNodes(from: startOfRange, to: endOfRange)
// Returns all children in the given range
```

All nodes in the AST contain a `range` property where the `lowerBound` and `upperBound` correspond to the utf16 byte index where the node's content starts and ends. An additional `rangeIncludingMarkers` property extends `range` to include any delimiters and extra whitespace.

## Syntax
Cue is designed to be intuitive and invisible whenever possible. It should look more or less exactly the same as when it's printed on a book or in a script. 

### Headers
Headers, for example, are marked by their own keywords and an identifier:

```
Act I
Chapter 1
Scene The First
Page ðŸ’¯
```

You can use all or none of these headers to subdivide a document into smaller parts. 

Note that the identifier can be anything: roman numerals, raw text, emoji, or anything else that suits your fancy.

In addition, you can optionally give each header a title by adding a hyphen.

```
Chapter I - An Unexpected Party
```

### Description
Unmarked text is treated as ordinary description and can contain any variety of plain text.

```
Jack went to the store to buy some milk, but he came home with a Jack Russell Terrier instead.
```

Or, if you prefer a more traditional screenplay-style of prose:

```
The door opens to reveal Jack, both arms wrapped around a nervous Jack Russell Terrier. There is no milk to be seen.
```

It also inherits a similar inline syntax to Markdown.

```
Emphasis is marked by *asterisks*.
Links to images and other embeddable files are wrapped in [brackets].
```

### Cues
The real power of Cue, however, comes from the way it treats dialogue. On a fundamental level, dialogue is just scene description targeted at one person. This targeted direction is called a cue.

```
Jack: This part of the document is meant specifically for me.
```

Other cues can be targeted at other people and departments. Indeed, any part of the mise-en-scene can have a cue if it suits the writer and production team.

```
Audio FX: This is a cue for the audio department.
Cut to:
```

The last line is an example of a self-describing cue. It doesn't need any further description because the cue name *is* the description.

Cues that are meant to overlap with each other can be marked with a caret.

```
Jack: This is a line of dialogue.
^Jill: This is a line meant to be spoken at the same time.
```

### Lyrics
Lines that are meant to be sung are marked with a tilde.

```
Jack: ~This is a song
      ~That extends multiple lines
      ~And in theory could go on forever...
```

### Facsimiles
The begining of a letter (or email, or sign, *et al.*) is marked with a right angle bracket.

```
> Dear Mr. Potter,
> You are out of eggs.
> Love,
> The Dursleys
```

### Whitespace
Note that whitespace in Cue is generally ignored, allowing you to align lyrics and cues however you please.

```
	Scene 2
       Jack:	~This is
				~a stanza of music
Christopher:	~Aligned by the begining
				~Of each lyric line
	   Jill:	~And by the end
				~Of each cue name
```

The only exception is for newlines. Unlike Markdown, Cue counts every single line

```
This is line #1

This is line #3 because it comes two lines after line #1.
```

### Comments
You can also write comments.

```
// Lines beginning with two or more slashes are considered comments.
```

### Ending
Every great work deserves closure. When you've reached the end of your story simply put:

```
The End
```
