# Cue
Cue is a Markdown-style language for writing stories for print, screen, and stage. For more information on the spec go to www.dylanthejoel.com/cue.

This library is for parsing and interpreting Cue. While the Cue spec continues to develop, the API will also continue to undergo changes. Until the Cue spec reaches 1.0, it should be considered unstable.

## Dependencies
Every attempt has been made to remove the need for external dependencies. As a result, anything that can compile Swift can compile the Cue library.

## Installation
It is strongly recommended that you use the Swift Package Manager to install Cue. To do so, add this line to your dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/dmcarth/Cue.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 4)
```

## Usage
The bread and butter of the Cue library is the Cue class, which accepts a string and provides some useful views onto the parsed data.

```swift
import Cue

let parser = Cue("Hello world!")

let ast = parser.ast 
// An abstract syntax tree

let table = parser.tableOfContents
// An array representing a table of contents

let html = parser.html()
// Transforms the parsed input into HTML.

let names = parser.namedEntitiesDictionary
// A dictionary of names, counting their occurences in the original string
```

### Rendering
Cue uses its own internal HTML renderer to output HTML, but it also defines two public protocols for rendering Cue: `Renderer` and `MarkupRenderer`. 

For more information on rendering Cue, such as for syntax highlighting or for a custom HTML renderer, please see the docs.

## Syntax
Cue is designed to be intuitive and invisible whenever possible. It should look more or less exactly the same as when it's printed on a book or in a script. 

### Headers
Headers, for example, are marked by their own keywords and an identifier:

```
Act I
Chapter 1
Scene The First
Page ðŸ’¯
```

You can use all or none of these headers to subdivide a document into smaller parts. 

Note that the identifier can be anything: roman numerals, raw text, emoji, or anything else that suits your fancy.

In addition, you can optionally give each header a title by adding a hyphen.

```
Chapter I - An Unexpected Party
```

### Description
Unmarked text is treated as ordinary description and can contain any variety of plain text.

```
Jack went to the store to buy some milk, but he came home with a Jack Russell Terrier instead.
```

Or, if you prefer a more traditional screenplay-style of prose:

```
The door opens to reveal Jack, both arms wrapped around a nervous Jack Russell Terrier. There is no milk to be seen.
```

It also inherits a similar inline syntax to Markdown.

```
Emphasis is marked by *asterisks*.
Links to images and other embeddable files are wrapped in [brackets].
```

### Cues
The real power of Cue, however, comes from the way it treats dialogue. On a fundamental level, dialogue is just scene description targeted at one person. This targeted direction is called a cue.

```
Jack: This part of the document is meant specifically for me.
```

Other cues can be targeted at other people and departments. Indeed, any part of the mise-en-scene can have a cue if it suits the writer and production team.

```
Audio FX: This is a cue for the audio department.
Cut to:
```

The last line is an example of a self-describing cue. It doesn't need any further description because the cue name *is* the description.

Cues that are meant to overlap with each other can be marked with a caret.

```
Jack: This is a line of dialogue.
^Jill: This is a line meant to be spoken at the same time.
```

### Lyrics
Lines that are meant to be sung are marked with a tilde.

```
Jack: ~This is a song
      ~That extends multiple lines
      ~And in theory could go on forever...
```

### Facsimiles
The begining of a letter (or email, or sign, *et al.*) is marked with a right angle bracket.

```
> Dear Mr. Potter,
> You are out of eggs.
> Love,
> The Dursleys
```

### Whitespace
Note that whitespace in Cue is generally ignored, allowing you to align lyrics and cues however you please.

```
	Scene 2
       Jack:	~This is
				~a stanza of music
Christopher:	~Aligned by the begining
				~Of each lyric line
	   Jill:	~And by the end
				~Of each cue name
```

The only exception is for newlines. Unlike Markdown, Cue counts every single line

```
This is line #1

This is line #3 because it comes two lines after line #1.
```

### Comments
You can also write comments.

```
// Lines beginning with two or more slashes are considered comments.
```

### Ending
Every great work deserves closure. When you've reached the end of your story simply put:

```
The End
```
